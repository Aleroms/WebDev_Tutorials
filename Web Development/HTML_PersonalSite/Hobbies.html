      <p>
        This was back in 2017, San Diego.My skills haven't changed that much since then.

  <h2>Travelling</h2>

  <p>I like exploring places that I have never been to. I love the beach too</p>

  <h2>Cars</h2>

  <p>Definitely not my car but it would be nice modifying a car. My wallet says no </p>

  <h2>3D Modelling</h2>
  <img src="Images/Large_Intestine - Copy.PNG" width="400" alt="">
  <p>This was a model I had created for a research project i'm on. This game teaches
  entering bio freshmen the anatomy of the body. I really liked this project because
  most models were organic and that made the each model more challenging.</p>

  <h2>Photoshop</h2>
  <img src="Images/a starry church - Copy.jpg" width="400" alt="">
  <p>This one is my favorite project i've done in Photoshop. It's a church in Mexico
  and Vincent Van Gogh's "A starry night"</p>
